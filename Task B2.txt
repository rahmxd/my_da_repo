Task B2: Discover and plan: library checkouts


Data Questions:


Question 1: What are the most borrowed item types in the library, and how has their popularity changed over the years?


* Transformation Steps: Combine data from librarycheckouts_2014, librarycheckouts_2015, and librarycheckouts_2016. Group by item type and year to count checkouts.


Question 2:  Where are the high-traffic locations in the library, and how does it vary by collection?


* Transformation Steps: Join librarycheckouts data with library_inventory_matches and library_System_Data_Dictionary to get location details. Group by location and collection to analyse foot traffic.


Question 3:  Who are the top borrowers, and what types of items do they frequently check out?


* Transformation Steps: Analyse librarycheckouts data to identify users with the highest checkout counts. Join with library_inventory_matches for item details.


Question 4: Are there any seasonal trends in library usage? How do checkouts vary throughout the year?


* Transformation Steps: Group checkouts by month and visualize trends over multiple years


Question 5: How diverse is the library’s collection in terms of item types, and has this diversity changed over the years?


* Transformation Steps: Analyse the distribution of item types and track changes annually.


Question 6: Are there specific days of the week when the library experiences higher foot traffic?


* Transformation Steps: Group checkouts by day of the week and analyse patterns.




Transformation Steps:


1. Combine Data: Merge librarycheckouts_2014, librarycheckouts_2015, and librarycheckouts_2016 into a single dataset for comprehensive analysis.


2. Standardise Item Types: Utilise the library_System_Data_Dictionary to standardise item types across years for consistent analysis.


3. Enrich Location Information: Join librarycheckouts data with library_inventory_matches and library_System_Data_Dictionary to enrich location details.


4. User Analysis: Aggregate librarycheckouts data to identify top borrowers based on checkout counts.


5. Temporal Analysis: Consider creating a date hierarchy for time-based analysis, enabling comparisons over months and years.


6. Data Quality Checks: Check for missing or inconsistent values and handle them appropriately for accurate insights.


7. Data Visualisation: Plan charts/graphs to effectively communicate findings for each data question.






Additional Notes from CSVs:

Call number: tells us the address of the book in the library, where it is located.


Bib number: a unique identifier for each bibliographic record in the catalog.
